                <h2>KGF-II <span>☆</span><span>☆</span><span>☆</span><span>☆</span><span>☆</span></h2>
                <p>KGF exceeded all of my expectations.. There isn't really a love element in the film to spoil it too much.. 
                    I found the entire movie held my interest.. this will definitely be the film you're looking for.. 
                    This film has numerous memorable scenes that verge on the hysterical including the yash in the gold Fields..
                    Neel as a director is mind blowing and his secret, I believe, is his obvious respect for his audience,. 
                    Prashanth Neel And Rocking Star yash deserve a standing ovation.. I will always be remembered this......

                <h2>Laxmii (2020)<span>☆</span><span>☆</span><span>☆</span><span>☆</span><span>☆</span></h2>
                <p> Over acting, poor directing, Thirdclass production with fourth class story, 
                    if you wanna spare yourself please dont watch this movie. 
                    Here the story basically is ak is a Muslim who married a hindu girl through love jihad and 
                    roaming around with trying to prove that there is no sprit and hindu sadhus are all fraud..
                    okay even if that can be beared, copy cat scenes from 4th class Hollywood movies made wrost, 
                    even lallu Sallu can make better flim than this
                </p>

                <h2>Chhalaang (2020) <span>☆</span><span>☆</span><span>☆</span><span>☆</span><span>☆</span></h2>
                <p>Movie was super and better than movies released this year. Commendable performance by all the actor and actress 
                    in the movie. There wouldn't be a moment where you feel boring. Better than soty1/2, panga. A good sports oriented 
                    movie and also a family film. It wouldn't have come at a better time then this. Hats off to the director and producer.
